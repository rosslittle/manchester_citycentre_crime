Manchester City Centre Crime Stats
===========================

The files contained here were taken from police.uk and, as far as I am aware, are public information and free to use and disseminate.

The site onlye offers May 2013 until December 2013 as a CSV download - the js files contained herein are taken directly from the XHR requests made by the crimae map web application. 

The files contain json array objects and I have therefore added .js to the end of them which makes GitHub parse them which produces no output. To see the file contents, click the Raw button to avoid this.

Any problems - ross@rjl.im
